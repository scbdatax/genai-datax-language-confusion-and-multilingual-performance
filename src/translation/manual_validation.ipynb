       "\"Amendment of the Plan\\nSupreme Court Decision No. 5818/2546 (Source: Rehabilitation Book by Ajarn Auan)\\nIn this case, there were 5 remaining creditors eligible to receive debt repayment in the business rehabilitation. The rehabilitation plan proposed to fully repay 3 creditors. For creditor T. Company (Creditor Group 4), which is the parent company of the debtor, and the objector (Creditor No. 9), the plan stipulated that these two creditors would receive only 15% of their debt repayment. Only the objector opposed the plan, citing unfair treatment as their debt was reduced by 85% and they would receive only 15% repayment.\\nThe plan preparer filed a petition to amend the plan, increasing the debt repayment to 45%. Although this amendment was not legally compliant, it demonstrated that the objector indeed received unfair treatment regarding the insufficient amount of debt repayment according to the plan. However, on the day of plan consideration, the objector submitted a statement confirming that if they received the debt repayment as specified in this statement, which was more than what the plan preparer had amended, they would not object to the plan further. The plan preparer agreed to amend, though not to the full amount proposed by the objector, to allow the rehabilitation to proceed and ensure the repayment amount was not less than what would be received in case of bankruptcy.\\nThe Central Bankruptcy Court appropriately accepted this petition to amend the plan, solely for the purpose of forwarding it to the official receiver to present to the creditors' meeting for consideration and further legal proceedings.\\nSupreme Court Decision No. 5818/2546 (Source: Rehabilitation Book by Ajarn Auan)\\nThe Bankruptcy Act B.E. 2483 (1940), Sections 90/45, 90/48, 90/44, and 90/63, stipulates two periods for plan amendment:\\n\\nDuring the creditors' meeting to consider the plan (Sections 90/44 and 90/45), which is an amendment before the creditors' meeting considers the plan.\\nRequesting an amendment after the court has approved the plan (Section 90/63).\\n\\nAccording to these provisions, whether amending the plan before or after the creditors' meeting, the amendment request must be submitted to the official receiver at least 3 days before the meeting date. Only the creditors' meeting has the authority to approve or reject the amendment, not the plan preparer.\\nEven if the creditors' meeting resolves to amend the plan, the amended plan must be brought back to the creditors' meeting for a special resolution under Section 90/46 to accept or reject the amended plan. After the creditors' meeting passes a special resolution to accept the amended plan under Section 90/46, the official receiver must report to the court for a decision on whether to approve the plan, requesting a hearing according to Section 90/56.\\nIt is evident that the plan or amended plan to be considered by the court for approval must first pass through the process of acceptance by the creditors' meeting resolution. The plan preparer's petition to the Central Bankruptcy Court only stated that the amendment to increase the objector's (Creditor Group 3) debt repayment from 15% to 45% had received consent from the creditors. As it was not amended through a creditors' meeting resolution and the creditors' meeting did not pass a resolution to accept the amended plan as prescribed by law, this amendment was not legally compliant. Therefore, the Central Bankruptcy Court's order approving this improperly amended plan was also not legally valid.\""
